/* The team locker: one manager's wall, everything they have to be proud of on
   it at once.

   The hall's wings are league-wide and argue about who holds what. A locker
   does not argue — every manager has one, every one of them has something in
   it, and nothing on the wall is a lowlight. It reads as a wall rather than an
   aisle: you see the whole thing on arrival, then zoom into any piece of it.

   Rows run down the wall in the order a trophy case fills up:

     flag        the team's colours, across the top
     pennants    one per playoff berth, hung point-down from a rail
     honours     a gold star per scoring title, a ribbon per best record
     shelf       a league trophy per title, a silver bowl per title game
     plaques     personal bests, mounted in a row

   A row centres itself and wraps when it runs long, so a manager with one
   berth and a manager with five both get a composed wall. The whole thing is
   built when a locker is opened and thrown away when it closes: ten lockers of
   canvas textures resident at once is not worth the memory.

   On a phone the same wall is folded narrower — fewer to a row, a shorter shelf,
   a smaller flag. A portrait screen has width to spare in exactly the direction
   a wall does not need it, so the fold trades the empty sides for a wall the
   thumb scrolls down and pieces roughly twice the size. */

     a phone that never gets scrolled. What it costs is size: six personal bests
